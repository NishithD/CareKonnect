# CareKonnect

The global pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) spawned a healthcare crisis globally and revealed some of the deep underlying problems in our countryâ€™s healthcare system resulting in a total failure of the healthcare system such as:  
- Lack of adequate information about the symptoms of the disease.   
- Financial losses due to unexpected medical charges    
- Unavailability of beds in the hospitals for the affected
- Ethnic disparities in the healthcare system, etc. 

These problems are really common during some acute outbreaks in some parts of the country.  

## Problem Statement: 
We aim to develop a Realtime Healthcare Web-Application for hospitals to tackle the above obstacles.
It can be used by the patients/common people to-  
- Ask for some first-aid or get information about the disease from the chatbot 
- Connect and have one to one conversation (chat) with certified doctors 
- Apart from this, the application would also consist of statistics about the ongoing pandemics around the world as well as information about adequate medical supply outlets available across different parts of the country

## Start Instructions

To run the react app: 

### Client Side:

```
cd client
npm install
npm start
```
### Server Side:

```
cd server
npm install
npm start
```

## Real-life Applicability 

The web application implements multiple features like one stop solutions to all the basic needs and health information required by the users. 
The main users of our application will be the hospitals who will act as admins and can appoint their doctors on this portal. This way, only certified doctors will be able to access the application. Moreover, patients can use this application for free and can resolve their doubts and ailments by booking an appointment with these doctors. They can approach the doctors through chat as well as through video calling. Moreover the patient and even doctors can locate nearby medical stores if they are stuck in an unknown city during the lockdown to get necessary medicines and healthcare services. The application also provides updates about the statistics of COVID-19 and its different variants.
